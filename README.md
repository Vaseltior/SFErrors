# SFErrors [![CI Status](https://travis-ci.org/Vaseltior/SFErrors.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Vaseltior/SFErrors.svg?branch=master)

A basic but interesting way of handling errors in Swift. 
This little framework is based on the work of David Owens II 

[https://github.com/owensd/SwiftLib/](https://github.com/owensd/SwiftLib/)

This framework is intended to be part of a bigger one and this bigger
one will rely on `SFErrors` using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/) as a bundler-er.
